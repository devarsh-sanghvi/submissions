-- D. Outside The Box Questions

/*
How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
	We can calculate rate of growth on basis of following:
	no of new users
	no of pro plan users
	no of stable users
*/
/* What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
	screen time of users
	ratio of visited videos vs completed videos
	category of cusin most wacthed
	category of cusin most interacted
	user-age wise most interestd cusins
*/
/*
What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
	which category of videos most viewed before customer joined pro plan
	geographical relation between users and content
	which category of videos most viewed before customer churn the plan
*/
/*
If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
	Was the content of their interest was on Foodi-FI. If not what was missing?
	Was the content on Foodie-fi informational?
*/
/*
What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate?
How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
	A powerfull recomendation system can help foodie-fi to grow and expand dynamically (example netflix knows our interest better than us)
	As shorts are getting too much attention nowadays. Fooie_fi can add shorts for regional trending contents and promote cusins to another level.
	Foodie_fi can organise meet-ups and build an awesome community which can create a new category of "customized by community" giving exposure to awesome chefs as well entertaining invention of new cusins exclusively on Foodie_fi
